# FarFetchChat
This project was made in the scope of WSDM - Web Search and Data Mining, with the objective of developing a conversational agent that will help users find the products they wish, by allowing the user to talk about the product features, answer questions about it and finding similar or matching products. The implementation consists in connecting the 3 components to the development of this conversational agent:
Chrome Extension that will work as the User Interface, which will pop-up whenever a user opens the Farfetch website in his browser. This UI will allow the user to send and receive messages and productâ€™s images, upload images and audio files.
Backend - using Flask, a backend framework, where most of the logical functionality will be.
Opensearch - a scalable open-source software suite for search and analytics.

PS:To currently test the chatbot, you have to run the server locally. Also to install the extension simply go to extensions, load extension, and put the build folder.
